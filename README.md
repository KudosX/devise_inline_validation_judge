## Test app to prove Judge gem works with Devise but, didn't work with simple_form
- New App generated by my template.rb (github.com/KudosX/template.rb):
- Ruby 2.3.1
- Rails 5.0.0.rc1

- https://github.com/joecorcoran/judge this repo worked fine
- https://github.com/joecorcoran/judge-simple_form couldn't get this gem to work with simple_form
- the main things to include are:
- :builder and validate code in registrations/new.html.erb, i did not include in other files
- create judge initializer
- add require and js code in application.js file
- mount engine in routes.rb
- added `alert(messages.join(','));` in application.js file for popup
